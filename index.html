        <h1> What is "Just Keep Swimming"?</h1> 
        <p>
          Life can be tough, throwing problems and roadblocks our way. It's easy to feel swamped, like you're sinking in troubles. But that's exactly when a positive attitude is most important. Let me ask a question, how many of you know how to swim or have taken lessons on learning how to swim? 

It's like having a life raft in a stormy sea. It might not stop the waves, but it can keep you afloat and help you navigate towards calmer waters.  A positive attitude can turn a rough sea into an exciting adventure.

          You see, focusing on the positive isn't about denying the existence of problems or pretending that everything is fine when it's not. Rather, it's about choosing to embrace optimism in the face of adversity. People may look at a glass as half empty, but they don't seem to realize how grateful they should be to have a glass in the first place.

          I can speak from personal experience when I say that navigating through these waters is not an easy feat. But it was during these moments that I learned the true power of resilience, of refusing to be defined by my circumstances.

In this process I learnt that you can't predict what's going to happen. The only thing I can do is be confident in times of uncertainty. "When life gives you lemonade, make lemons" as Phil Dunphy said.
